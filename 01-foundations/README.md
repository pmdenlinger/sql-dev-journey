The progression of topics aligns with widely accepted SQL fundamentals as presented in introductory SQL literature. Examples and datasets here are original and adapted for legal, audit, and compliance reporting contexts.

### Next Steps

This notebook establishes foundational SQL query patterns and schema reasoning.

Subsequent sections build on this foundation by introducing:
- Performance considerations and query planning
- Large-scale audit and log datasets
- Compliance, defensibility, and Microsoft Purview / Entra reporting scenarios
