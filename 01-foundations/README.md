### SQL Foundations

This notebook establishes foundational SQL concepts using an existing SQLite database. The goal is to develop fluency in exploring schemas, writing clear queries, and interpreting results.

The progression of topics reflects widely accepted SQL fundamentals commonly introduced in introductory SQL literature. The database is used as-is to establish baseline query patterns; all queries, commentary, and interpretations are original and adapted for legal, audit, and compliance reporting contexts.

The database is treated as an external system under review, reflecting common real‑world scenarios in audit and compliance analysis.

### Next Steps

This notebook establishes foundational SQL query patterns and schema reasoning.

Subsequent sections build on this foundation by introducing:

- Performance considerations and query planning
- Large‑scale audit and log datasets
- Compliance, defensibility, and Microsoft Purview / Entra reporting scenarios
